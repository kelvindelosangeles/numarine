            </header>
            <p class="subtitle">A desire to be better than the rest</p>
            <p class="body">
                Stronger, faster, better... Ömer Malazs' mission to create a motor yacht designed to provide unrivalled performance and comfort when
                cruising the world's two thirds led to the birth of Numarine. "From my own experience spending leisure time with my family on board
                various types of motoryachts, I always felt there was something missing, I was always wanting more and our needs were never
                satisfied." Could we go where we wanted when we wanted? Did we have everything we needed for extended time aboard? Could we entertain
                in space and comfort with all the provisions we would need? Were my family safe and comfortable? The answer always came back as no.
                Out of this list of desires and the fact they were left unfulfilled, the vision to create the perfect motoryacht came about and
                Numarine was born.
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle2">Realising the Dream</p>
            <p class="body">
                To create a company that would stand out and deliver on the mission set down right at the start, exhaustive research led to a set of
                conclusions that would subsequently be delivered and upheld, conclusions that formed the core of what we are today. Our yachts had to
                be of the highest quality in order to compete in a saturated market place so only the best componentry could be used. In order to
                deliver on the performance, economy and range requirements, we had to save weight so inspiration was taken from the aviation and
                racing industries where intelligent material choices were resulting in extreme weight saving also delivered unrivalled strength and
                ride comfort therefore vacuum infusion and composites were to be the only choice capable of delivering on our promise. We would outfit
                our yachts with an abundance of amenities and convenience features as standard and we would offer our clients the ability to customize
                so as to deliver on their exacting requirements. With our mission set out and its deliverance achievable, a purpose built facility was
                created, the latest technological manufacturing techniques were refined, a team of the best craftsmen, engineers and designers were
                assembled, and partnerships were formed with the industry's leading vendors.

            </header>
            <p class="subtitle">
                From day one, Numarine has used the very latest in vacuum infusion technology and composite materials to produce extremely rigid,
                lightweight and incredibly strong hulls.
            </p>
            <div class="body">
                With the extremely technical vacuum infusion process, lightweight, composite materials such as Kevlar and Carbon Fibre are placed into
                the moulds in a highly complex strategic order so as to fully benefit from each of material's unique properties. The "sandwich" of
                materials is then fused together under vacuum as the resin bonds all the elements together in a temperature controlled environment.
                The end result of this delicate process provides our owners with a hull approaching the strength of steel with a weight saving of up
                to 30% versus a traditionally laminated hull. This increased strength repels impacts in rough water whilst the decreased weight
                delivers inherent economy and performance benefits.
            </div>
            <p class="subtitle2">Covered</p>
            <p class="body">
                We have absolute confidence that our construction process and material choices result in the strongest hulls on the water. This
                confidence is guaranteed by Gurit – the composite industries leading supplier of materials and engineering services through their
                exacting structural calculations on our hulls. This confidence allows us to offer the very best warranty in the industry and so, from
                the bottom up, every Numarine hull comes as standard with a full, 10 Year Structural Warranty.
